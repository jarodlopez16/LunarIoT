Lunar Internet of Things Project

Goal: Build an Internet of Things (IoT) system for the lunar surface in collaboration with students from Rowan University and members of NASA’s Stennis Space Center. 
<ul><li>Autonomous operations of lunar devices, enabling a rover to traverse the lunar surface in an efficient manner. </li>
<li>Establish communications between devices over an MQTT broker, allowing for the reception and analysis of data (i.e. battery station power levels).</li>
<li>Real time data processing to enable decision making, allowing rover to determine the most optimal path between objectives and battery stations.</li></ul>
WHY?: As NASA makes advancements in establishing a sustained human and robotic presence on the Moon, there is a growing need for:
<ul><li>Reliable communications among assets on the lunar surface.</li>
<li>Autonomous decision making to reduce the impact of communication delays between the Earth and lunar surface.</li>
<li>Efficient power management for extended missions in extreme lunar environments.</li>
<li>Data systems to handle reception and sending of information for analysis.</li>
<li>Compliments NASA’s LuCCI project</li>
Successful implementation of the IoT system provides for:<ul>
<li>Communication amongst devices, enabling autonomous systems to operate in a more efficient and cooperative manner</li>
<li>Minimal human interaction in the operation of assets on the lunar surface</li></ul></ul>
