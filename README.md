Lunar Internet of Things Project

<ul>Goal: Build an Internet of Things (IoT) system for the lunar surface in collaboration with students from Rowan University and members of NASA’s Stennis Space Center. 
<li>Autonomous operations of lunar devices, enabling a rover to traverse the lunar surface in an efficient manner. </li>
<li>Establish communications between devices over an MQTT broker, allowing for the reception and analysis of data (i.e. battery station power levels).</li>
<li>Real time data processing to enable decision making, allowing rover to determine the most optimal path between objectives and battery stations.</li>
WHY?: As NASA makes advancements in establishing a sustained human and robotic presence on the Moon, there is a growing need for:
Reliable communications among assets on the lunar surface.
Autonomous decision making to reduce the impact of communication delays between the Earth and lunar surface.
Efficient power management for extended missions in extreme lunar environments.
Data systems to handle reception and sending of information for analysis.
Compliments NASA’s LuCCI project
Successful implementation of the IoT system provides for:
Communication amongst devices, enabling autonomous systems to operate in a more efficient and cooperative manner
Minimal human interaction in the operation of assets on the lunar surface</ul>
